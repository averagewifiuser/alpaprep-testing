TO RUN THE FILE

1. OPEN CMD
2 NAVIGATE TO THE MAIN FOLDER WITH THE cd command
for example: cd C:\Users\Jnr\Desktop\Alpha Prep App
note: this would not work for you because your pc isn't called Jnr, change that to your pc username and it should work fine

3. TYPE THIS IN THE CMD
python run.py

4. IF YOU HAVE FLASK AND ALL THE PIP INSTALLATIONS REQUIRED, THE SERVER SHOULD START UP

5. SOME STUFF WON'T WORK BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE MY DATABASE AND THE PASSWORDS AND ALL HAQ HAQ HAQ 

6. MORE CLEAN UPS WILL BE DONE TO CODE SOON
HAVE FUN! THOUGH IT WON'T WORK!

7. IMPORT THE DATABASE WITH THE WORK BENCH. YOU NEED THE WORK BENCH ANKASA NOT CMD

OTHER THINGS:
SOME  THINGS ARE STILL UNFINISHED BUT WOULD BE POLISHED WHEN WE MERGE
THANK YOU!

SORRY FOR CAPS, IT'LL MAKE READING EASIER. I AM NOT SHOUTING.
OH AND I'M JUST KIDDING, THE APP WILL WORK if you read the 'how to.txt' and install necessary sturvs :D

WITH LOVE HAQ HAQ HAQ
